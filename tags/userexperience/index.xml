      <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems that my minor thesis will focus more on the user experience of augmented reality. The EIA&amp;#8217;s have raster outputs that can be converted to 3D spaces. These spaces can then be given Locations. The Raster is already georeferenced which would make this easier (I think).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best method of viewing these things would seem Augmented Reality browsers such as Layar or Junaio. So I would have to brush up a bit on what is possible in which browser. Both are iPhone and Android compatible which is convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a later stadium it might be cool to add 3d models of ships going to the harbour. (wishful thinking).&lt;/p&gt;
