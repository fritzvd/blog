      <title>Connecting the Dots</title>

&lt;p&gt;Those who think they &amp;#8220;know&amp;#8221; everything from the beginning will never, in fact, come to know anything &amp;#8211; &lt;strong&gt;Thomas Merton&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few weeks (months) I haven&amp;#8217;t been posting too much. Sorry about that. For all the people who are interested in what I am doing a little update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment I am trying to write up the document to present the thesis to my supervisors. The research part is almost brought to an end with this step. Then the big question is, what are my findings?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t quite distilled that to a complete concrete conclusion, but I can say this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3D GIS is not an easy thing. Depending on the quality of the 3D visualization of course. But trying to get the coordinate systems of a Geographical System to work together with 3D software and their coordinate systems is not an easy feat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An instance of Augmented Reality is only as good as the purposes it should serve and the requirements it should fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, LaTeX is an awesome markup tool for word processing. If someone is interested in the title page for a thesis at the WUR (Wageningen University and Research) just comment and I&amp;#8217;ll send you the .tex file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Monday!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>From 2.5D to 3D</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My last few posts have focused on somewhat other things than my thesis. This does not mean that no progress has been made or that I&amp;#8217;ve done nothing. On the contrary; I&amp;#8217;ve done quite a bit. But it is rather less exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been busy with data conversion and trying to get a working 3D representation that is meaningful. Which is hard and not so spectacular. Seriously. First of all getting to grips with the fact that the reason why ESRI is marketleader may be because they deliver a complete and good package. My stubborn, innovative-creative side however always pushes me to look beyond the big things, before trying them out. That does not always pay off. Also trying out hip and open-source packages in Windows is just plain brutal. It sucks the life out of me. Cygwin/MinGW is utter pain, and Python for Windows is hell. Give me OS X or Â Debian-linux anyday (apt-get FTW).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I am trying to make a 3d representation of things with ArcGIS (ArcMap and ArcScene). But even then trying to deal with different formats remains a chore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this, and only after this I have to even more conversions to get it going in any Augmented Reality or 3D instance online or on a smartphone. The best to go for now is ArcScene -&amp;gt; export 3D (VRML) -&amp;gt; Open in Meshlab -&amp;gt; export to 3Ds or DAE. Which is a sucky workflow, but like, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there&amp;#8217;s that.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Usability and 3D in Geovisualization</title>
      <link>http://blog.fritzvd.com/2010/09/29/considerations-on-3d-visualization-for-gis/</link>

      <guid>http://blog.fritzvd.com/2010/09/29/considerations-on-3d-visualization-for-gis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my minor thesis I am thinking of a project for processing Environmental Impact Assessment in a way that is more easily comprehensible. For this project I intend to use Augmented Reality. Hopefully some form of 3d visualization. And I am looking at the possibilities of using gaming engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, this is a preliminary research. I am not in any way an expert. And only just learning about the amazing possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few days I have been looking at different scholarly and not so scholarly papers in search of some good information on the use of game engines in 3d visualizations of GIS. The search has been quite fruitful but not conclusive. Aren&amp;#8217;t these searches always.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway. This is more or less a note to self. To remind myself what I&amp;#8217;ve found and where. But if you&amp;#8217;re interested please follow this blog to see the outcome of this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visualization using Game Engines is something that has over the last decade caught the attention and imagination of more people than just me. Not surprisingly because the gaming industry is leading the field in wonderful visualizations and magnificent displays of Artificial Worlds and the interaction of the user with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Fritsch and Kada &amp;#8211; Visualization Using Game Engines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dieter Fritsch and Martind Kada of the Institute for Photogrammetry in Germany has written an introductory overview on different game engines and their applicability and capabilities for visualization in 3d. His conclusion clearly states the possibilities but also the complications. These mainly consist of data format. Common GIS data patterns are very different to most 3d data types. Polygons and points are usually a bit more complex more on this in number 3. A project called GISMO apparently is quite capable of rendering large data sets and are quite user friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Herwig and Paar &amp;#8211; Game Engines: Tools for Landscape Visualization and Planning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting conclusions and research on the increased involvement of stakeholders and planners. Not necessarily a very technical paper. But good for reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Scianna and Ammoscato &amp;#8211; 3D GIS Data Model Using Open Source Software (2010)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting article on using the Python bindings of Blender to process GIS data. They start of by stating why they chose to use Blender for the research and not other open source 3d software. There is quite a difference in data types as already mentioned between usual 3d rendering and design software and GIS data types. Unlike GIS types points and lines do not form the primitives of 3d software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blender and the GIS RDBMS PostGIS are then linked through a Python script. And data is sent back and forth. Python scripts are available online: &lt;a href=&#34;www.dirap.unipa.it/python_scripts&#34;&gt;Link does not seem to work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Slocum et al. &amp;#8211; Cognitive and Usability Issues in Geovisualization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a more academic work on cognitions and user friendliness. Different methods of working with Geovisualization are proposed. Good for reference and Usability things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. MacEachran (editor) &amp;#8211; Exploring Geovisualization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huge collection of articles on Geovisualization. From Usability and Cognition, to Data Handling and 3D interfaces. Chapter 28 was quite useful on Usability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course much more literature has been leafed through, but these are some of the articles or books that I found worth mentioning in the introduction of my proposal. Next time some more literature overviews and then hopefully some conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
