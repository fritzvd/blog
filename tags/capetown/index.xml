      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cape Town is freaking awesome. I realize this every time I wake up again. Last time I was here was in 2006 during DTS in Muizenberg. To be back here is nice. To hang out with Simon, Marieke and Noah is lovely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few days I have (with the help of anti-biotics) conquered flu, challenged Poseidon and battled the fierceness of the wrath of Simon and his axe. I have survived all, and still remain strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swimming in the ocean here, is like dipping your self in a bath of salty ice water with lots of current. Oh, how I love swimming in the sea. The last few times I went to the ocean, I could not curb my enthusiasm, but ripped of my clothes and jumped head first in to the sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is of course a flipside to being in Cape Town. The contrast between the poorest and the richest is vast, and oftentimes just 500 meters apart. In a place of such a richness in beauty, surfing and mountain flora there is also a painful poverty. Adjacent to the souvenir shops a large township rises forth from the ground. It is a miracle that rich people can live here without a care. I blame it on a growing of calluses on the heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I will continue doing what I am doing. Chilling, hanging out and going into Ocean View (township) with Simon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I arrived safely at Cape Town Int. Airport. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.simonandmarieke.com&#34;&gt;Simon, Marieke and Noah&lt;/a&gt; came to pick me up. A bit surreal to see them, but very good nonetheless. Surreal because I have seen so many places in quite a short amount of time over the last few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time I posted something on my blog, I did so from the town of Victoria Falls in the North-West of Zimbabwe. After posting we went to see the world famous Falls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they are astounding. What an awesome, tremendous display of power and majesty that is. Roaring like a lion does a herd of wild waters rush down the steep ridges. Rush down and come back up again, come back up again in victorious mist that shatters sunlight into a million pieces. A rainbow so bright that it does not seem to be real. A sight so violent that it seems unlikely to bring life wherever the water flows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Vic Falls, we hitchhiked back to Bulawayo, this time a free ride in a nice Land Cruiser. In Bulawayo we spent another 2 days before I travelled back toÂ Johannesburg. That was quite a crazy experience. Although I chose a well trusted company: Greyhound, the bus driver took more passengers than allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other special thing, the border post. You have never seen queues like you have seen them at the Zimbabwean-South African border post. We stood in a queue literally reaching up to at least 150 m. (I shot a little film clip that I will upload somewhere in the near future). Furthermore we spent 4 hours crossing the border before we could continue driving to Johannesburg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for now, I am in Cape Town. Enjoying and loving the time I have with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.simonandmarieke.com&#34;&gt;Simon Marieke and Noah&lt;/a&gt;. Over the next three weeks I will just be hanging out with friends and wha-evs. For new phone number see contact page.&lt;/p&gt;
