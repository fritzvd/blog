      <description>Over the weekend I was at FOSDEM, an open source developer conference in Brussels. We had a blast. I sat in on a talk at the Legal &amp;amp; Policy Issues room about community building by Eileen Evans. The talk was the one she gave at OSCON 2013 (attached below). The short version of the talk was that the license an open source project uses plays a role in the community it will create, perhaps such a strong role as governance or the technology itself, but a role nonetheless.</description>

The Scale and Datarange command look very similar and I haven’t figured out quite how to set it properly, or how to have three-color scale. However it’s a start. And I haven’t found it documented anywhere else, here you go.</description>
