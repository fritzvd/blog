      <title>FBX and 3d models in Monogame &amp;#8211; on Linux</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR the monogame community is pretty great&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately my manic ambitious mode has turned on again for me. So I have about 100s of ideas again, which sadly of course will all come to nothing. But while I&amp;#8217;m at it, I thought I&amp;#8217;d make the best of it to do some tutorials here and there and learn some stuff I know nothing about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with Monogame on Linux is kind of a hassle to start with, but if you push through it works. At the time of writing this I got Monogame 3.4 to work: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.monogame.net/downloads/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Monogame Downloads Page&lt;/a&gt;. If you&amp;#8217;re not very comfortable with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real problem was that a tutorial I tried to follow had an old style FBX file that the Monogame Content Pipeline was not willing to load. Everyone told me to use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blender.org/download/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Blender&lt;/a&gt; to convert it. But.. Blender wasn&amp;#8217;t loading my file, because it was ASCII based. So I had to find a converter. I found the Autodesk one for Linux somewhere in the attic of the internet. I&amp;#8217;ll host it &lt;a href=&#34;http://meuk.technokrat.nl/fbx_converter&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; so I know for sure it won&amp;#8217;t go missing. So install that thing, and convert it (if necessary import and export in Blender too, just to make sure). Your Content Pipeline will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. you can find some great free models here: &lt;a href=&#34;http://tf3dm.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://tf3dm.com/&#34;&gt;http://tf3dm.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://tf3dm.com/3d-model/puo-67895.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The featured image is a model made by 3dgenerator: &lt;a href=&#34;http://tf3dm.com/3d-model/puo-67895.html&#34;&gt;http://tf3dm.com/3d-model/puo-67895.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Developments so far</title>
      <link>http://blog.fritzvd.com/2010/11/18/developments-so-far/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2010 15:53:56 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.fritzvd.com/2010/11/18/developments-so-far/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ok. 3 weeks down the road of my minor thesis and what do I have to show for? Well, a lot of paradigms and concepts for starters. Furthermore I have never been able to finish a document like research proposal so quickly and of such quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But enough of that. I have more or less abandoned the idea of a mobile application for now. Because having a mobile application like Junaio scores high on the cool list, it doesn&amp;#8217;t really in the sphere of performance and handling large data sets. The preference might go to having a standalone or online application that uses a webcam to model the information on screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most interesting technologies so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The awesome &lt;a href=&#34;http://unity3d.com&#34;&gt;Unity 3D&lt;/a&gt; game engine. Apparently possible to combine with &lt;a href=&#34;http://technotecture.com/content/sstt-visualizer-augmented-reality-demo&#34;&gt;SSTT&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; AR tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The extensive Python libraries of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vtk.org/&#34;&gt;VTK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/&#34;&gt;Mayavi2&lt;/a&gt; (installing in Ubuntu costs only 10 min.) in combination with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gdal.org/&#34;&gt;GDAL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://sourceforge.net/projects/opengamaray/files/&#34;&gt;(Open)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gamaray.com/&#34;&gt;Gamaray&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; An AR toolkit similar to UnifeyeSDK (Junaio) by Metaio. Possibility to add location and 3d objects. Very cool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another harsh realization is that I have grown too fond of Ubuntu Linux and only now have to deal with an issue that other programmers have been dealing with for ages. Building from source. My goodness. In Mac this feels too dangerous as a mismanaged system can have a lot of missing dependencies and building takes quite a while. In Windows this absolute hell. Searching around for pre-compiled binaries is the way to go, as are packages like Pythonxy. But still, this sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I have been able to do so far (except for spending days writing and compiling) is importing an Aster Satellite image into the Mayavi2 viewer. Which was remarkably painless and cool. The only thing is that I do not really understand yet what it is showing me. I guess the pixel values of one band have become the Z-axis. Still, cool as Sir Dangles.&lt;/p&gt;

    View from the middle
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_193&#34; style=&#34;width: 410px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignnone&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://fritzvd.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/aster2.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://fritzvd.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/aster2.png&#34; alt=&#34;Aster Image&#34; title=&#34;aster2&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;290&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-193&#34; srcset=&#34;http://blog.technokrat.nl/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/aster2-300x217.png 300w, http://blog.technokrat.nl/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/aster2.png 400w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    View from above
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also importing height maps in Unity3D should be not be too painfull, but this proved a bit harder than anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Considerations on which Gaming Engine to use</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A quick update on my project of using a Gaming Engine to process GIS data. After some googling and reading other peoples blogs and workspaces it seems that some engines are more fit than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tim Germanchis et al. (2005) has done a brief overview of different game engines for this particular usage. Amongst which are the Quake III, Unreal Runtime 2, CryEngine and others. The CryEngine apparently suited the writer the most. As it was easy to learn, stable and the most powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However according to the [A quick update on my project of using a Gaming Engine to process GIS data. After some googling and reading other peoples blogs and workspaces it seems that some engines are more fit than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However according to the](&lt;a href=&#34;http://gis-game.pbworks.com/&#34;&gt;http://gis-game.pbworks.com/&lt;/a&gt;) (coming up in almost all of my searches on Google) this Engine is not very favourable. By the way if anyone knows who these guys are, I would love to come into contact with them. But found it kind of difficult to contact them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One major objection I personally have with CryTek is that it is a Windows only Software. As I will have to do most of my development behind a Windows I will probably would be in the temptation of cutting my lifeline short. But it does make it easier to user CryEngine as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also saw that CryEngine 3 is coming out. Maybe my Prof would like to help me to get a Educational license to start working on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In relation to open-sourcing and stuff: ioquake3. The well-known quake3 engine has been released under the GPL license as ioquake3. So maybe that is worth giving a try. Although it is a bit older. But then again, science seems to lag in this field anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my major concerns is the processing of GIS data in 3d. I hope that I can find a way with Python and bash maybe to automate the modeling of the 3d objects. Although that might be wishful thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other concern I will discuss tomorrow. As it is time for me to do some studying for my courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: &lt;a href=&#34;http://uaraus.altervista.org/index.php?filename=en/content/categories/Blender/DEM_importer.html&#34;&gt;this looks interesting for DEM and Blender things&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
