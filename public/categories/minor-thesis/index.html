The research part is almost brought to an end with this step.</p>

        <p>My last few posts have focused on somewhat other things than my thesis. This does not mean that no progress has been made or that I&#8217;ve done nothing. On the contrary; I&#8217;ve done quite a bit. But it is rather less exciting. I&#8217;ve been busy with data conversion and trying to get a working 3D representation that is meaningful. Which is hard and not so spectacular. Seriously. First of all getting to grips with the fact that the reason why ESRI is marketleader may be because they deliver a complete and good package.</p>

        <p>In my little project I would like to add some _I_nteraction. A possibility to zoom in and out and rotate the 3D model without moving the marker but by using some form of hand gestures. This should be possible. Though, the road towards it still seems a bit unclear. For now I have investigated the possibility of loading the 3D model as a static object until other markers arrive on the scene and are able to manipulate position, rotation and zooming.</p>

        <p>Today I fooled around a bit with the FLARManager (tutorials graciously provided by transmote). I tried to get some Papervision 3D objects going using all these different tutorials I have been following over the last few weeks (e.g. papervision2.com and rawkes.com). But it has not been as easy as I had expected. But then again, things never are. The difficulty is not so much in displaying 3D objects, because pv3d and flarmanager do all the thinking for you.</p>

        <p>A little update on what I am doing. Today is a pictureless day, too bad. Moving away from Mayavi2 I have been moving towards ActionScript and Flash. Why this switch? Well Mayavi2 is a real cool scientific visualization tool, but most of the focus is on on-the-fly visualization of data that is dense, but also a computer that is powerful. This does not really serve useful for the purposes I would want to move towards.</p>

        <p>Ok. 3 weeks down the road of my minor thesis and what do I have to show for? Well, a lot of paradigms and concepts for starters. Furthermore I have never been able to finish a document like research proposal so quickly and of such quality. But enough of that. I have more or less abandoned the idea of a mobile application for now. Because having a mobile application like Junaio scores high on the cool list, it doesn&#8217;t really in the sphere of performance and handling large data sets.</p>

        <p>It seems that my minor thesis will focus more on the user experience of augmented reality. The EIA&#8217;s have raster outputs that can be converted to 3D spaces. These spaces can then be given Locations. The Raster is already georeferenced which would make this easier (I think). The best method of viewing these things would seem Augmented Reality browsers such as Layar or Junaio. So I would have to brush up a bit on what is possible in which browser.</p>

        <p>Another consideration is if using Augmented Reality (AR) how to implement it and what method of going about it. ARToolkit has different spin-offs that look quite interesting. One of my favourites are FLARToolkit and possibly SLARToolkit. The flash toolkit. But then I am not very proficient in Flash and ActionScript. Also I tend to avoid Flash as much as possible as well as writing stuff in C#. But the office I work in makes it easier to use C# then any other binding.</p>
