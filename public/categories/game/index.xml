      <description>TL;DR the monogame community is pretty great
Lately my manic ambitious mode has turned on again for me. So I have about 100s of ideas again, which sadly of course will all come to nothing. But while I’m at it, I thought I’d make the best of it to do some tutorials here and there and learn some stuff I know nothing about.
Starting with Monogame on Linux is kind of a hassle to start with, but if you push through it works.</description>

      <description>Ok. It’s official as of 16.04 (CET) I have entered in all of the above mentioned GameJams. This is where I will track my development.
The project can be found at: https://github.com/fritzvd/abime
It. Is. On!
Update:
Note to self: Neko target in Haxe does not handle placement of BitmapData well. Been spending an hour to get it to work. Other target was instant.
&amp;lt;strong Update 2: This was a very bad week to be working on something like this.</description>

      <description>For some this will be a trivial example. For me this took a bit longer than I suspected.
This small example will produce this:
If you’re planning on making an awesome game you probably want a particle emitter. because.. well look at it.
What I did is I started a haxepunk project:

      <description>This is basically a fancy note to self. Last year in my pre vacation spending spree, I boughy myself (and my brother) a NYKO Playpad Pro. A pretty cool gamepad for Android. I had lots of fun playing GTA Vice CIty on my trip to Italy. Playing SNES games etc.
However I tried to hook it up to my Linux pc and thought I would be able to use it with my new go to MetroidVania platformer: Guacamelee.</description>

      <description>So I started venturing off in a direction in which I have no experience what so ever. Only on the consumer-side of things ;-). Game development. Of course I had no idea what I was doing. Still don’t.
To start with I had no idea where to start. Lately I have been looking into Unity 3D and Unreal engine, but then I realized I suck at drawing and have no idea how to start with 3d.</description>
