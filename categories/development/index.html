        <p>This topic of course ties in with the Building Communities session. Because building community happens with code that is being used. And if you want people to be able to join easily, one of their first entry points will probably be the README, which has for some projects become the only or the main documentation. At the moment the documentation of some projects is exemplary (think: anything @substack makes). Whereas the documentation of node itself is kind of a mess.</p>

        <p>A lot of the talks were not just about code or &#8220;hardcore&#8221; technical stuff, but also about social things like: building community, writing documentation, creating a safe environment. Which in the software meetups and talks scene has been growing as a topic. To dismay of some, and celebration of others. This session started out as a discussion about the node project, &#8220;the Fork&#8221;: io.js and what it says about the community and the culture of node.</p>

They evolve over time and are supplemented with new words every month, new phrases every year and acquires (minor) grammar changes every decade. This true for speaking languages as well as for programming languages. The past year there has been a lot of talk about EcmaScript 6 (a.k.a.

        <p>Containers, like the ones you put sundries in? Linux Containers (LXC) have been a hot new topic over the last 2 years. The easiest way to understand a container is to compare it with a Virtual Machine (VM). You can run a VM on your machine and it will pretend to be a computer inside a computer. It will emulate hardware so it can run an Operating System (OS) within your computer.</p>

        <p>N.B. This one of the first sessions held at nodeconf, everybody was still somewhat rusty. Isomorphic JavaScript is the practice of using the same JavaScript code on the server and in the browser. In the session we talked about how to best implement this, and what to avoid. The naming is ridiculous, so let&#8217;s just use Universal JavaScript. One of the first recommendations were to do static analysis. This goes through your code and finds dead dependencies or function that are never called.</p>

        <p>TL;DR the monogame community is pretty great Lately my manic ambitious mode has turned on again for me. So I have about 100s of ideas again, which sadly of course will all come to nothing. But while I&#8217;m at it, I thought I&#8217;d make the best of it to do some tutorials here and there and learn some stuff I know nothing about. Starting with Monogame on Linux is kind of a hassle to start with, but if you push through it works.</p>

This project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project. Rules There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors: No &#8211;force pushes or modifying the Git history in any way. Non-master branches ought to be used for ongoing work. External API changes and significant modifications ought to be subject to an internal pull-request to solicit feedback from other contributors.</p>

The project can be found at: https://github.com/fritzvd/abime It. Is. On! Update: Note to self: Neko target in Haxe does not handle placement of BitmapData well. Been spending an hour to get it to work. Other target was instant. This was a very bad week to be working on something like this.</p>

        <p>Over the weekend I was at FOSDEM, an open source developer conference in Brussels. We had a blast. I sat in on a talk at the Legal &#038; Policy Issues room about community building by Eileen Evans. The talk was the one she gave at OSCON 2013 (attached below). The short version of the talk was that the license an open source project uses plays a role in the community it will create, perhaps such a strong role as governance or the technology itself, but a role nonetheless.</p>
