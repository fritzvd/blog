      <description>This might be a repost of some sort. However I found that it was kind of hard to find anything about this specific topic. So here it goes.
Kriging is a geostatistical method to be able translate point data to a grid, to find out where you can predict stuff really well and where the variance is really high. As always GIGO (garbage in garbage out). But it is at least a large improvement from interpolation techniques such as Inversed Distance Weighting (IDW) which is often implemented in GIS software.</description>
