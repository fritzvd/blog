      <description>It was a long drive home, it always was. It&amp;rsquo;s always a longer drive than anyone ever hoped. No drive is really is short enough after 2 o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning. Last time she drove this way home it was with Craig right beside her. He&amp;rsquo;d been playing third that evening. Suzie had played second violin. As she had done for a few years now. Back then, she was new to the gig and Craig always liked driving together.</description>
