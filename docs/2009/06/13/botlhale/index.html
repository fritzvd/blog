  <section><p>After being here 3 weeks (today is the start of my fourth week in the South), I thought it’d be good to give another update. This week marks the start of my real ‘field’ research. The previous two weeks of staying in Gaborone were weeks of article reading and enhancing (read: writing anew) my proposal.</p>
<p>Actually I was planning to leave for Mopipi on Monday. However, there are always unexpected changes in this world. I’m sorry to say that I found out yesterday that my interpreter/assistants grandmother has passed away. My sincere condolences to her family.</p>
<p>So a slight change in plans. This week I will still stay in Gaborone to start prepare all the data processing things and to process some satellite imagery.</p>
<p>In my last post I said something about it be so extremely dry here. Well, things have changed. Monday last it started raining like crazy. Most unusual for winter. Moreover because it rained for 4 days. Luckily things have changed again. The sun is shining again and skies are blue. This a big relief, because staying in a house without central heating, can get cold at times.</p>
<p>Apparently some people have been asking about what I’m up to and what I’m doing here. To relieve my beloved of these difficult and comprehensive questions there is a brief explanation on the link (above): <a href="http://blog.fritzvd.com/research">research</a>.</p>
