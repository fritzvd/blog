  <section><p>Last Monday I arrived in Mopipi after a 7 hour journey. This is the village I am doing my research in. The house I am staying in is really nice. Mercy, my assistant is renting a room there. The in situ room left a little corner for me. There is a bathroom with running (drinking) water. Even hot water! Mercy has a tv and a fridge (yes, there is electricity). So we have a bit more luxury to retreat to after doing the household surveys. The days are quite busy and in the evening I have to enter data and every second day make diner as well. And internet is not omni-present, so this update might feel a little late. Sorry for that.</p>
<p>Everyday we walk through the village to go to several households and ask some questions about their use of firewood. When I walk through the village with my really cool straw hat, the children shout: Lekgoa, lekgoa. The Setswana word for white man. So I shout back at them: black child, black child. No, I don’t, but that would be funny wouldn’t it?</p>
<p>People are very friendly and are very willing to help us. Yet I do sense some resentment to another research. Looks like these people have had researchers come here for a few years now.</p>
<p>On a less serious, but equally important note: I have tried some hip things. Deep fried Mophane worms are one of them. They are a type of caterpillars that walk the Mophane trees. As well as sorghum porridge with sour milk. And some local (sorghum) beer.</p>
<p>Also they have something called Magwinya. Very close to Afrikaans ‘vetkoek’ and Dutch ‘oliebollen’ (zonder krenten). Also I can now make phalitshe (pronounced as polidge), the name for the maize porridge. To try and fix your air-bed just as you do a flat on your bike is also a treat.</p>
<p>Lastly you should know I have an awesome T-shirt tan by now :).</p>
