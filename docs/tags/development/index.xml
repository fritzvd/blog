      <description>Last time I wrote something about something very simple, but something I really enjoy. Conditional classes and inline event handlers. It’s not a very difficult or complex feature. But I did not find a lot of writing about it. And also it saved me loads of jQuery statements that you don’t want in a controller, but in the UI.
Next up: Directives. Directives are pret-ty awesomevilles. For the “stop/play video player like”-thing we are building, we would like to have a timeline or time slider, to go back to a previous images.</description>

      <description>Last few weeks at work I have been trying out Angular JS. First of all, because it is fun and useful to try out new stuff. Secondly because after working with Backbone/Marionette for a few months some things felt that they could’ve been done better. So whilst working on a big Backbone/Marionette project I started looking at Angular a bit.
I’ll just show you some of my favourite features. We are building an app that needs to play, stop, pause etc much like a video player.</description>

      <description>Vagrant is a great tool if you like to develop and test on the same server. Or at least emulate that you have the same server and at the same time keep your own system fairly clean.
I’ve been using it for quite a while. After reinstalling my ubuntu machine to get rid of 12.10 and start 12.04 LTS a fresh I had to fix something in my install of vagrant.</description>
