      <description>This has been a little mystery for me waiting to be uncovered. However I solved it. Depending if you are using a SLD (styled layer descriptor) or the embedded Style commands this is what your Mapfile could look like:
MAP NAME &#34;Some Map&#34; DEBUG ON FONTSET &#34;/home/fritz/maps/fonts.txt&#34; WEB IMAGEPATH &#34;/tmp/&#34; IMAGEURL &#34;/tmp/&#34; METADATA &#34;wms_title&#34; &#34;WMS Demo Server&#34; ##required &#34;wms_onlineresource&#34; &#34;http://localhost/cgi-bin/mapserv?map=map.map&#34; ##required &#34;wms_srs&#34; &#34;EPSG:42304 EPSG:42101 EPSG:4269 EPSG:4326 EPSG:7030 EPSG:32736&#34; ##recommended END END PROJECTION &#34;</description>

      <description>Those who think they “know” everything from the beginning will never, in fact, come to know anything – Thomas Merton
Over the last few weeks (months) I haven’t been posting too much. Sorry about that. For all the people who are interested in what I am doing a little update.
At the moment I am trying to write up the document to present the thesis to my supervisors. The research part is almost brought to an end with this step.</description>

      <description>When working on a GIS project, this always bums me out. You need to have a certain area in which you want to cut all your source data. But in ArcGIS I never figure out how to do it properly, except for using Python scripts and arcgisscripting/arcpy. But I figured, this should also be do-able from the terminal, and take less time and energy from your little workbox.
But here’s a Python script that uses open-source libraries and writes</description>

      <description>My last few posts have focused on somewhat other things than my thesis. This does not mean that no progress has been made or that I’ve done nothing. On the contrary; I’ve done quite a bit. But it is rather less exciting.
I’ve been busy with data conversion and trying to get a working 3D representation that is meaningful. Which is hard and not so spectacular. Seriously. First of all getting to grips with the fact that the reason why ESRI is marketleader may be because they deliver a complete and good package.</description>

      <description>Ok, this took a while but the results are not bad. So I guess it’s worth it.
First of all, a big thank you at [Ok, this took a while but the results are not bad. So I guess it’s worth it.

      <title>Random thoughts Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>http://blog.fritzvd.com/2010/09/30/augmented-reality/</link>

      <description>Another consideration is if using Augmented Reality (AR) how to implement it and what method of going about it.
ARToolkit has different spin-offs that look quite interesting. One of my favourites are FLARToolkit and possibly SLARToolkit. The flash toolkit. But then I am not very proficient in Flash and ActionScript. Also I tend to avoid Flash as much as possible as well as writing stuff in C#. But the office I work in makes it easier to use C# then any other binding.</description>

      <title>Considerations on which Gaming Engine to use</title>

      <description>A quick update on my project of using a Gaming Engine to process GIS data. After some googling and reading other peoples blogs and workspaces it seems that some engines are more fit than others.
Tim Germanchis et al. (2005) has done a brief overview of different game engines for this particular usage. Amongst which are the Quake III, Unreal Runtime 2, CryEngine and others. The CryEngine apparently suited the writer the most.</description>

      <title>Usability and 3D in Geovisualization</title>

      <description>For my minor thesis I am thinking of a project for processing Environmental Impact Assessment in a way that is more easily comprehensible. For this project I intend to use Augmented Reality. Hopefully some form of 3d visualization. And I am looking at the possibilities of using gaming engines.
First and foremost, this is a preliminary research. I am not in any way an expert. And only just learning about the amazing possibilities.</description>
