      <description>So just before new year’s eve started, I started a (cyanogenmod) update for my phone (lg optimus 2x). Wiped data/cache/dalvik and did not get to flashing the new zip. But then the guests started to arrive and I left it, without having it hooked up to a power supply. Big mistake. There are a number of recovery images out there, (amongst the most well-known: Clockwork Mod and TeamWin Recovery Project). I was on TWRP but it just hung and could not get out of recovery mode.</description>
