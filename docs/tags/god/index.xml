      <description>Tuning into a TV program sporting The Face – Kings of Leon last week got me thinking. The program is called In Search of God and features 3 Dutch Celeb’s which are facilitated with a number of conversations and travels that should help them find God. Or at least give a nudge in that general direction or other.
I found the program to be most intriguing and turns out to probably be my favorite show of the year (next to the Big C, which is also deserves a great mention here).</description>
