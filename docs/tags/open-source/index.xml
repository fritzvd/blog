Non-master branches ought to be used for ongoing work.
External API changes and significant modifications ought to be subject to an internal pull-request to solicit feedback from other contributors.</description>

      <description>Over the weekend I was at FOSDEM, an open source developer conference in Brussels. We had a blast. I sat in on a talk at the Legal &amp;amp; Policy Issues room about community building by Eileen Evans. The talk was the one she gave at OSCON 2013 (attached below). The short version of the talk was that the license an open source project uses plays a role in the community it will create, perhaps such a strong role as governance or the technology itself, but a role nonetheless.</description>

      <description>This has been a little mystery for me waiting to be uncovered. However I solved it. Depending if you are using a SLD (styled layer descriptor) or the embedded Style commands this is what your Mapfile could look like:
MAP NAME &#34;Some Map&#34; DEBUG ON FONTSET &#34;/home/fritz/maps/fonts.txt&#34; WEB IMAGEPATH &#34;/tmp/&#34; IMAGEURL &#34;/tmp/&#34; METADATA &#34;wms_title&#34; &#34;WMS Demo Server&#34; ##required &#34;wms_onlineresource&#34; &#34;http://localhost/cgi-bin/mapserv?map=map.map&#34; ##required &#34;wms_srs&#34; &#34;EPSG:42304 EPSG:42101 EPSG:4269 EPSG:4326 EPSG:7030 EPSG:32736&#34; ##recommended END END PROJECTION &#34;</description>
