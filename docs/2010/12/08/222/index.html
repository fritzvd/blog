  <section><p>Today I fooled around a bit with the <a href="http://words.transmote.com/wp/flarmanager/">FLARManager</a> (tutorials graciously provided by transmote). I tried to get some Papervision 3D objects going using all these different tutorials I have been following over the last few weeks (e.g. <a href="http://papervision2.com">papervision2.com</a> and <a href="http://rawkes.com">rawkes.com</a>). But it has not been as easy as I had expected. But then again, things never are.</p>
<p>The difficulty is not so much in displaying 3D objects, because pv3d and flarmanager do all the thinking for you. But trying to get from a GIS file to the right formats and the right information to be displayed in the right way, is still a bit tricky. The model still has to correspond with the actual data that was used, but more often than not these models contain very dense data on a large scale. For now the model has been so big that I only saw a small fraction of it in my display the rest hovering quietly above it. Need to find a smarter way to doing this than:</p>
<p><code>3dobject.scale = 0.001;</code></p>
<p>But I’ll get there I’m sure.</p>
<p>For now I can render multiple cows on my desktop. And at least that is something right?</p>
<div id="attachment_223" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/cows.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-223 " title="cows" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/cows.png" alt="Desktop Cows" width="400" height="302" /></a>
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Property of Papervision2.com I think
  </p>
</div>
<p>P.S. Why cows instead of GIS (the model is just small and loads quickly, good for testing purposes.)</p>
