Ok quick recap. I haven&#8217;t blogged for about a week and a bit, and a lot more has happened than all my weeks here I think.
  
So here we go. I&#8217;ll try to compress it in small bits.

Last week we had the profs and staff of the Desire project with us to help us, (or rather the other way around). All of us went and picked up cow dung to measure the weight, to get a &#8216;feel&#8217; of how much an average kraal would produce. From here on we can make an estimation as to how much biogas an average kraal can produce.
  
Furthermore we went into the field at different sights, to count trees (ditlhare). Differentiated into species diameter etc. to obtain insight into how much biomass fit for firewood the surrounding of the village has.

Than something completely different happened as well. A friend of mine and I had run into each other at the WUR in April and found out that we would in Botswana at the same time, so we made an arrangement.
  
Last thursday we met eachother in Maun. This was a small vacation for me. I tagged along with Michiel and Annegina for 5 days. Very relaxed and just lekker to see and talk some Dutch again.
  
We went into the Okavango on a boattrip with the three of us and saw crocodiles (dikwena). Lots of them. And big ones! Oh my word.

Also saw a couple of hippos. But they&#8217;re a bit scary. When they go into the water you can&#8217;t see them. So you have to take some distance with your boat, because they can decide to tip it and snap your back. (hip hip)

Close to the place we were staying &#8211; Sepopa &#8211; another fascinating sight was to be spotted: Tsodilo Hills. In a country mostly level with minor hills these small mountains are quite a stunning sight. The indigenous people in this area painted the rocks with paintings of the animals about 2.500 years ago. Quite interesting.

From today onwards I will be back in Mopipi to continue my work.
