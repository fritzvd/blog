Ok. It&#8217;s official as of 16.04 (CET) I have entered in all of the above mentioned GameJams. This is where I will track my development. 

The project can be found at: [https://github.com/fritzvd/abime](https://github.com/fritzvd/abime "abime")

It. Is. On!

**Update:**
  
Note to self: Neko target in Haxe does not handle placement of BitmapData well. Been spending an hour to get it to work. Other target was instant.

<strong Update 2: </strong>
  
This was a very bad week to be working on something like this. Next time I&#8217;ll clear my schedule. This was doomed to fail from the beginning. Lessons learned include:

  * got familiar with LÃ¶ve2D
  * got more familiar with HaxePunk
  * learned about ray casting
  * made some math mistakes
  * learned to free my schedule
  * deal with failure
  * great communities that make awesome games
  * lower the bar
