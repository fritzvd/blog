Cape Town is freaking awesome. I realize this every time I wake up again. Last time I was here was in 2006 during DTS in Muizenberg. To be back here is nice. To hang out with Simon, Marieke and Noah is lovely.

Over the last few days I have (with the help of anti-biotics) conquered flu, challenged Poseidon and battled the fierceness of the wrath of Simon and his axe. I have survived all, and still remain strong.

Swimming in the ocean here, is like dipping your self in a bath of salty ice water with lots of current. Oh, how I love swimming in the sea. The last few times I went to the ocean, I could not curb my enthusiasm, but ripped of my clothes and jumped head first in to the sea.

But there is of course a flipside to being in Cape Town. The contrast between the poorest and the richest is vast, and oftentimes just 500 meters apart. In a place of such a richness in beauty, surfing and mountain flora there is also a painful poverty. Adjacent to the souvenir shops a large township rises forth from the ground. It is a miracle that rich people can live here without a care. I blame it on a growing of calluses on the heart.

This week I will continue doing what I am doing. Chilling, hanging out and going into Ocean View (township) with Simon.
