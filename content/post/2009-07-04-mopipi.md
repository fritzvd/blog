This is now the second week already that I have spent in this place. It is quite an interesting place as you can see from the pictures I&#8217;ve uploaded.
  
Very salty, dry, windy, at times cold and desolate. People are friendly most of the time and I&#8217;ve made some friends.

Next week I will be doing something else than household surveys, which is a relief. It is quite boring to go to 140 households and ask the same questions over and over again. But we are already on 87 of the 140, that is a big relief. Next week I will be measuring the availability of firewood in the area with some people from the University of Botswana.

I&#8217;ve started a little side project with some locals. We are trying to build a solar cooker out of soda cans. Have to attend these people, so just take a look at the pictures (at the right of this post). And I&#8217;ll update you next week again.
