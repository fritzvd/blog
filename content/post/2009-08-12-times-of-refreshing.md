You know how sometimes, life just feels too good to be true? Well, the last few days have been like that. Being finished with my field work made me happy. This meant that I would be in an urban area again. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love nature. Just being in an urban area means you can have proper coffee again.

So the last few days, I have feasted on vegetables, fruits and other fresh produce withheld from me in Mopipi. Over the weekend I went to South Africa, to Pretoria for my grandfathers 85th birthday as well as a family reunion day in Potchefstroom.

Besides seeing my grandparents, my parents and lots of family members, I went to a normal church again, which was kind of a relief after quite some interesting services in the Mopipi area.

At the moment I am staying in Gaborone again and am hoping to finish quite a bit of work here before I have to leave the country. As for now, I hope to catch a glimpse of the meteor shower that is about to pass the skies tonight.

P.S. For all NSW people, 31st of July is not my birthday, it is actually 31st of October. <img src="http://blog.technokrat.nl/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
