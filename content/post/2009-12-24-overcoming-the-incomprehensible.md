Some things lie outside our command, some things outside our understanding. Or better yet, only some things lie in our command and understanding. Our eyes are limited, and our mind even more so. We see things that are not there, do not see things that might be there, speculate about how events take place in the (Super)Natural world. And all the while we think a real big deal of ourselves, whilst forgetting that we are very tiny.

We are so small (on a universe scale, we would be impossible to make out as a globe, even more so as individuals), that it would be ridiculous if we would be able to understand all, and if we would have control over everything in our day-to-day lives.

It is hard to think of a universe when we live in a world. Better yet, we live in a house, inside a city, inside a country, inside a continent, on a globe. So we tend to think of the distances between work and home as far. Sometimes, though, a small glimpse of the vastness is given. A glimpse of the unending, the infinite, the eternal.

However scary these glimpses might be, they also comfort me. They tell me I do not need to know or will ever know everything. Neither will I ever be able to have good reasoning for everything happening in my life. It makes me quiet and grateful. Grateful for the small victories and little joys we can experience in our little speck of time in the timeline of world history.
