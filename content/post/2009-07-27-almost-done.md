So this is a bit of an overdue post. But a post nonetheless. I am busy with the final stages of my field work here. And not very mournful about it. My time here has been good, but I&#8217;m also up for something different and some people I know and relate with more easily.

Last week I went around to measure the daily use of firewood in this place with a friend of mine. Which has been fun. My friend Moffat and I went from house to house everyday. The people are starting to know me and greet me more freely, which is nice.

Last weekend I spent at someone I know through the church in Gaborone. His name is John Walters. A missionary in Rakops for the last 16 years. Rakops is a village about 60 km from Mopipi. It was fun. He is from England and it was good just to speak some proper English, to enjoy some company with someone who understands Western ways a bit more. Also just to have a weekend of relaxing was nice as well.

John has the most awesome Land Cruiser in the world. A gift from a Dutch team that came up here. This old Safari truck from the 80&#8217;s. We went around to a Bushmen settlement close to Rakops and did a church service there. The cutest kids, really. And so in need of some love. You can see that most children are not used to play with their parents and thoroughly enjoy it when someone picks them up and swirls them around.

This week wil be another week of measurements and a presentation at the beginning of next week. After that I&#8217;ll take a bus down to Pretoria where I will be celebrating my grandfathers 85th birthday!
