  Don't "add" diversity when your code is ready to ship.

title: Building Communities @ nodeconf 2015

A lot of the talks were not just about code or &#8220;hardcore&#8221; technical stuff, but also about social things like: building community, writing documentation, creating a safe environment. Which in the software meetups and talks scene has been growing as a topic. To dismay of some, and celebration of others.

This session started out as a discussion about the node project, &#8220;the Fork&#8221;: io.js and what it says about the community and the culture of node. This meant 3 core contributors telling about where they see the project failed, and what it did right, but also how to progress in the future. 

First of all the io.js/node.js community would like to do better. They would like to be the role model for other projects. Adding stuff like a Code of Conduct instead of just code to a project. Some projects are still outshining in core values like: diversity, inclusivity and lowering the barrier to entry. And some projects are just outright mean. As an example the Johnny-Five (robotics) project was mentioned as a community which is really thriving and is able to maintain those key values, as
  
opposed to &#8220;that other robotics&#8221;-project in node. 

A reason for this was giving by one of their maintainers: &#8220;Focus on the right stuff early on&#8221;. And to be frank that is true of any kind of standard you want to have in a project. Do you want a clean code base? Focus on that early on? Do you want a lot of test coverage? Don&#8217;t add it as an afterthought. Do you want anyone from any color, creed and orientation to feel welcome? Don&#8217;t &#8220;add&#8221; that when your code is ready to ship.
