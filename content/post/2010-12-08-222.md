Today I fooled around a bit with the [FLARManager](http://words.transmote.com/wp/flarmanager/) (tutorials graciously provided by transmote). I tried to get some Papervision 3D objects going using all these different tutorials I have been following over the last few weeks (e.g. [papervision2.com](http://papervision2.com) and [rawkes.com](http://rawkes.com)). But it has not been as easy as I had expected. But then again, things never are.

The difficulty is not so much in displaying 3D objects, because pv3d and flarmanager do all the thinking for you. But trying to get from a GIS file to the right formats and the right information to be displayed in the right way, is still a bit tricky. The model still has to correspond with the actual data that was used, but more often than not these models contain very dense data on a large scale. For now the model has been so big that I only saw a small fraction of it in my display the rest hovering quietly above it. Need to find a smarter way to doing this than:

`3dobject.scale = 0.001;`

But I&#8217;ll get there I&#8217;m sure.

For now I can render multiple cows on my desktop. And at least that is something right?

<div id="attachment_223" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/cows.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-223 " title="cows" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/cows.png" alt="Desktop Cows" width="400" height="302" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Property of Papervision2.com I think
  </p>
</div>

P.S. Why cows instead of GIS (the model is just small and loads quickly, good for testing purposes.)
