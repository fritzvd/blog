<p style="text-align:left;">
  In the preparations for my trip, I find that slowly but gradually the stress, of the things needed to be done, starts to pile upon me. As for now I am trying to give my self a crash course in Setswana, the official language of the Batswana.<br /> But as with all things in life this is way harder than anticipated. Way harder. If I would like to say cup of coffee, it is not that difficult: kopi kofi (sounds a lot like the dutch). Yet if I want to borrow someones telephone, I can only say the word telephone. This is such a mouthful: mogola wa mosokela tsebeng. With just a cup of coffee I can come a long way.

<p style="text-align:left;">
  To relieve some stress I have recorded some <a title="music" href="http://last.fm/music/Phritz" target="_blank">songs</a>. But sometimes this a days work, so I will have to refrain from doing so until I have finished writing my research proposal.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  Some people have asked me what it is I am planning to do. The technical details are a bit boring. But I can give a hint of what I will be doing. The trip is part of my studies. In short I will show and promote other sources of energy. Maybe I can even try to showoff the solar cookers shown below.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  Furthermore I will be venturing off into adventure. This is what I like most about this trip. I mean how often do we have the chance of going to Botswana?!
</p>

For those interested, I will conduct a research concerning the use of fuelwood and the feasibility to switch to another, hopefully more renewable energy source. The use of fuelwood puts severe stress on the environment, and can cause further desertification (worsening and growing of a desert)
