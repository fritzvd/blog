        <p>There is something which has been lingering in my mind for a while now. It has been brooding one US president ago, and has been set to full throttle frustration when a nobel prize was awarded a week-and-some ago. US presidents have always, in the good-spirited leadership they posses, urged other &#8216;fragile states&#8217; that nuclear power is something that comes with great responsibility, just like spidey-senses. And of course fragile states cannot handle that kind of responsibility.</p>

        <p>When writing a thesis, it is imperative that you lose focus every now and then. So after reading some blogs, during the lunch-break, I decided to extend my lunch break. Little did I know I was destined to find out something extraordinary. When you try to find a search engine in Google, Google is the 5th result, (4th webpage) you&#8217;ll find. This of course is groundbreaking research in the field of Desertification and Development Sociology.</p>

        <p>Tonight I will be leaving South Africa to fly to the Netherlands. It has been good, but it is also time to go back. But before I go and before I close this blog down (or start posting non-interesting thoughts on how to design your own vegetable garden), I want to leave you with an impression of the country of my forefathers. The beautiful, complex and diverse South Africa whom I have grown to love.</p>

        <p>Cape Town is freaking awesome. I realize this every time I wake up again. Last time I was here was in 2006 during DTS in Muizenberg. To be back here is nice. To hang out with Simon, Marieke and Noah is lovely. Over the last few days I have (with the help of anti-biotics) conquered flu, challenged Poseidon and battled the fierceness of the wrath of Simon and his axe. I have survived all, and still remain strong.</p>

        <p>Yesterday I arrived safely at Cape Town Int. Airport. Simon, Marieke and Noah came to pick me up. A bit surreal to see them, but very good nonetheless. Surreal because I have seen so many places in quite a short amount of time over the last few days. Last time I posted something on my blog, I did so from the town of Victoria Falls in the North-West of Zimbabwe. After posting we went to see the world famous Falls.</p>

        <p>Right now I am testing the limits of the slowest connection in the world, as I speedtype this blogpost in existence. I am writing from Vic Falls in Zimbabwe. A very touristy but nice place. The last few days I have been staying with the aunt and uncle of Washington. Very nice christian people, who took us in the house and helped us on our way. Yesterday we have arrived safely in Vic Falls.</p>

        <p>After enjoying a lovely Windhoek Special (a nice beer), I felt like updating my blog. First of all, because I haven&#8217;t done so for a while. Secondly, because my time in Botswana draws to a close. The last few days have been busy. Writing, looking at data, finishing a philosophy paper which had a deadline which was a bit more urgent than my thesis. Today I decided that I could have a bit more of a chill-out-day.</p>

        <p>You know how sometimes, life just feels too good to be true? Well, the last few days have been like that. Being finished with my field work made me happy. This meant that I would be in an urban area again. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love nature. Just being in an urban area means you can have proper coffee again. So the last few days, I have feasted on vegetables, fruits and other fresh produce withheld from me in Mopipi.</p>

        <p>On a slightly more positive note than the last post, I am doing fine. Really. I actually forgot to write about one of the most significant events of last week. There was no water (Ga gona metsi). Seriously. This was big mathata (problems). We had to fetch water in barrels, drums, and empty trash bins. Luckily some of my friends here helped me with their skoro-koro (a car that is close to it&#8217;s end).</p>

        <p>So this is a bit of an overdue post. But a post nonetheless. I am busy with the final stages of my field work here. And not very mournful about it. My time here has been good, but I&#8217;m also up for something different and some people I know and relate with more easily. Last week I went around to measure the daily use of firewood in this place with a friend of mine.</p>
